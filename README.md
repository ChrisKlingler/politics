## Setup 

### Supabase 

1. **Create Supabase Project**: Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2. **Enable Email Provider**: Navigate to the Authentication page in the Supabase dashboard. In the Configuration tab, enable the Email Provider. In our simple example, we disabled Secure Email Change. This is not our recommendation and we consider enabling it in production would be helpful.
3. **Configure URL Callbacks**: In the URL Configuration section, add the Site URL and Redirect URLs for login and change email address callbacks. Replace **testproject** with the name of your Supabase project.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Site URL:** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; io.supabase.testproject


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Redirect URLs:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; io.supabase.testproject://login-callback/
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  io.supabase.testproject://change-email/


### Flutter

1. Run **flutter pub get**
2. Add Supabase Project URL and Public Anon Key:
    * In your main.dart file, locate the **_initializeSupabase()** method.
    * Replace **PROJECT_URL** and **PUBLIC_ANON_KEY** with your Supabase project URL and public anon key respectively. You can find these in the API settings tab inside the Project Settings section on Supabase.
3. Setup Deeplinking URLs:
    * Edit the **ios/Runner/Info.plist** file: Update **CFBundleURLSchemes** to match your Site URL.
    * Edit the **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** file: Update intent-filter to match the scheme and host of your Site URL and Redirect URLs.
    * Open **/lib/core/constants/urls.dart** and update **_baseSupabaseUrl** to match your Site URL.
